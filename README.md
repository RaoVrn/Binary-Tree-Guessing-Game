**Binary Tree Guessing Game**

This is a simple guessing game where you think of a number and the computer tries to guess it. You will be asked a series of yes or no questions to help the computer guess your number.

The game file is named `questions.txt`. You can edit this file to add or remove questions. Each question should be on a separate line, and the format should be:

```
<question number> <question>
```

For example:

```
1 Is it a song?
2 Is it a festive song?
3 Is it a Christmas song?
4 Is it by Wham! ?
```

**To play:**

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the `BinaryTree` class.
3. Select the `P` option from the menu to play the game.
4. Think of a number and answer the yes or no questions honestly.
5. The computer will try to guess your number. If it guesses correctly, you win! If not, you can try again or select another option from the menu.

**Other options:**

* `L`: Load another game file.
* `D`: Display the binary tree.
* `T`: Display tree traversals.
* `H`: Help information.
